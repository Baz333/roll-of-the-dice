# roll-of-the-dice
By Barry Nolan and Liam Flynn
This was a group project for the module Introduction to 3D Game Development

The aim of this assignment was to create a 3D game in Unity with the theme 'Roll of the Dice', with at least one indoor scene and one outdoor scene, and to demonstrate our knowledge of ProBuilder, character and keyframe animation, lighting, trigger volumes, responsive audio and optimisation, interactable objects, and NPCs.
